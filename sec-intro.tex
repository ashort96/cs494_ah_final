\section{Introduction}

Writing low level code, such as assembly, is essential in writing software such as operating systems.
%
Every computer science student will have to write assembly at some point in their academic career.
%
However, there are not many tools available that allow students to easily learn how to write and debug their code.




Debugging while writing low level code, such as assembly, is very difficult for novice programmers, such as students.
%
Students have no good way to visualize what their code is going to do while it is running.
%
Additionally, students have a difficult time seeing why their code is breaking or having unexpected behavior such as infinitely looping.



\tool{} aims to solve this issue by giving the novice a sandboxed web interface that allows developers to see their code and how it affecting both the registers and the stack.
%
It also provides basic debugging tools that allow programmers to step through their code to determine what lines of code are causing what unexpected outcome.
