\section{Tool}

As shown in \ref{debug-memory-address-qemu}, debugging a range of memory addresses in QEMU is not easy.
%
\tool aims to fix this by providing two key features.
%
The first feature is the memory address viewer, which will allow developers to see memory in real time.
%
QEMU is currently set up to allow developers to see a memory address, but they must type the memory address they want to see.
