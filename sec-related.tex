\section{Related Work \& Background}

Novices often struggling learning how to program~\cite{teague2008collaborative}.
%
The difficulty often causes frustration~\cite{ihantola2010review}, which drives novice programmers away.
%
Visualizing their code, however, helps tremendously~\cite{rodrigo2009affective, smith2000programming}.
%
Other studies have shown that making the tool more personal to the novice programmer also has positive outcomes~\cite{lee2011personifying, soflano2015application}.
%


While there are plenty of tools and games that exist that help novices learn how assembly works at a high level, none of them help show what happens at the low level.
%
No tool exists that visually represents what is going on in the computer's memory space while the program is executing.
%
The tools and games that exist, such as EXAPUNKS and TIS-100 by ZACHTRONICS~\footnote{http://www.zachtronics.com/}, help teach novices basics.
%
However, there needs to be something more that teaches what the code is doing at the hardware level.



Visual representations are beneficial to more than just computer science.
%
Multitudes of studies show that visualization is a key learning concept~\cite{beeland2002student, lowe1999extracting, mayer2003three}.
%
Making these lower level languages, such as RISC-V, have a more visual aspect to them will allow more novices to learn it.
